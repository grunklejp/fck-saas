# fck-saas

Directory of "next-gen" open source self hosted software.

Heuristics for inclusion:

- Must be open source
- Can only be dependent on AWS or Cloudflare
- Must be self-hosted only (cannot offer a hosted version)
- Probably serverless
- Must be actively maintained
- Setup must be about one step
- [SST](https://sst.dev/) usage is a plus
- dual licensed software is a plus
- pay gating features is OK

> Submit a **PR** to add a new software to the list

> Submit an **Issue** with an idea for what you'd liked built and maybe a cracked developer will make it
